# Mandelbrot

By doing this project I practice different web technologies, including HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Spring Boot. Current version (July 2015) has the following features:
- drawing basic Mandelbrot set
- modifying the color palette by adjusting two colors (the actual palette is gradient between those two colors)
- zooming in by clicking on the image

My plan is to add the following features:
- saving images locally
- saving image data to mongodb database (with thumbnails?)
- creating "image gallery" for saved images (adding and deleting images)
